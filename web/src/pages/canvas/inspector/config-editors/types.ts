 * Shared types for the per-type config editors.

 *
 *   - `config` — the current `node_config` object for the selected node.
 *     Always a `Record<string, unknown>`; editors narrow individual keys.
 *   - `readOnly` — disables every input; used for read-only / view-only
 *     mode (e.g. version pinning, T14).
 *   - `onChange` — replaces the entire `node_config` with the new dict.
 *     Editors should treat `config` as *immutable* and emit a new object.
